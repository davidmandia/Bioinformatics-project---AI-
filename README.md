# Bioinformatics-project---AI-
1. -I am trying to develop a product in bioinformatics
2. -The scope of this project is the following:
3. Obtain data with SMILE, bioavailability, IC50
4. Build a deep learning model that predict the Bioavailability and IC50
5. That the will apply modification to the SMILE (many of them )
6. Predict Bioavailability and IC50 
7. Keep the modification with the highest gain in them
8. Print a version of the previous molecule and the new one (possibly 3d image )
9. Deploy it on cloud  (use https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/deeppk/api_docs API if deployed )
